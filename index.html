      <h3>Wear Eye Protection</h3>
      
      <p>It makes good practice to wear eye safety glasses if you plan
         to make a hobby of keeping Cacti. This is because most types of
         Cacti are coverd in various sizes of prickly spikes.

         A keen hobbyist may want to observe a pattern or flower close up
         and in their enthusiasm forget to look out for the spikes and
         end up getting a spike poked in the eye. You don't want this to
         happen to you. So always wear, gardener type saftey googles or glasses,
         which may be purchased from your local garden centre.

      <h3>Use Tongs</h3>        
      <p>The use of tongs are a cacti hobbyist best friend
         Plastic or metal tongs are good for Handling smaller
         cacti. Be careful though when Handling cacti as they 
         are easily damaged and carry there scars. Even safer
         would be to use gloves and tongs, and why not complete
         the profesional look put those safety googles as well.
         For an inexpensive and cost effective way of handling
         cacti, layers of newspaper may be used.

      <h3>Growing Medium</h3>
        <p>The purpose of the growing medium is to provide support and to store
           water, oxygen and dissolved minerals to feed the plant. In the case of
           cacti, there is general agreement that an open medium with a high air
           content is important.</p>

                <p>It is not known when cacti were first cultivated. Opuntias
          (prickly pears) were used for a variety of purposes by the Aztecs,
          whose empire, lasting from the 14th to the 16th century, had a
          complex system of horticulture.</p>

      <h3>Watering</h3>        
      <p>Semi-desert cacti need careful watering. General advice is hard to give,
         since the frequency of watering required depends on where the cacti are 
         being grown, the nature of the growing medium, and the original habitat 
         of the cacti. Brown says that more cacti are lost through the "untimely 
         application of water than for any other reason" and that even during the 
         dormant winter season, cacti need some water. Other sources say that water 
         can be withheld during winter (November to March in the Northern Hemisphere). 
         Another issue is the hardness of the water; where it is necessary to use 
         hard water, regular re-potting is recommended to avoid the build up of salts. 
         The general advice given is that during the growing season, cacti should be 
         allowed to dry out between thorough waterings. A water meter can help in 
         determining when the soil is dry.
